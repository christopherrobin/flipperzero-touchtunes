# flipperzero-touchtunes

This is the repository for what hopefully will become the Flipper Zero TouchTunes. 

Pin folder contains the remote signals broken out by admin code.
Typically most locations do not change the default 000 pin, so i would start there unless you already know the pin.


Credit to https://github.com/notpike for laying the initial foundation for the TouchTunes Yardstick one app, which then became a Portapack HackRF app as well as a Goodwatch app.
